As a user
I want to be able to configure where I store my secrets
So that I have a flexibility to set it up myself

Scenario #1:
Given: I have a secrets directory with gpg encrypted files that contain secrets AND
Given: I have provided environment variable RUSTILLIUM_SECRETS_DIRECTORY with the correct path
When: I open my application
Then: The application starts correctly and reads from the provided directory

Scenario #2:
Given: I have a secrets directory with gpg encrypted files that contain secrets AND
Given: I have a configuration file config.toml in directory $HOME/.config/rustillum with secrets_directory setting defined with the correct path
When: I open my application
Then: The application starts correctly and reads from the provided directory

Scenario #3:
Given: I have have both -- file from scenario #2 and environment variable from scenario #1
When: I open my application
Then: The application uses environment variable instead of configuration file (precedence rule)
