As a user
I want to be able to store a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) secret and see the current code
So that I can use two-factor authentication without needing a separate authenticator app

Scenario: Viewing and interacting with a TOTP field
    Given: I have a secret that contains a field with a valid "otpauth://" URL, keyed as "totpurl"
    When: I expand that secret's section in the main view
    Then: The application displays the current 6-digit TOTP code
    And: The application clearly indicates the remaining time until the code refreshes
    And: The displayed code automatically updates when the time period expires
    And: Clicking the displayed TOTP code copies it to my clipboard, showing a brief confirmation

Technical Notes:
1. For this feature to work, the `otpauth://` URL should be stored as a regular field with the key "totpurl".
2. The UI will handle parsing the URL and generating the code at display time. No backend changes are required for storage.
3. Editing the `otpauth://` URL is handled by the existing "Modify Secret" functionality.
