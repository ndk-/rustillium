As a user
I want to see clear, non-crashing error messages when something goes wrong
So that I can understand the problem and provide detailed reports if necessary

Scenario: Invalid TOTP URL
    Given: I have a secret with a malformed "otpauth://" URL in its "totpurl" field
    When: I expand that secret's section
    Then: The application does not crash
    And: In place of the TOTP code, a user-friendly error message is displayed (e.g., "Error: Invalid TOTP URL")
    And: All other fields for that secret are still displayed correctly
    And: The console logs a detailed, technical error message for debugging

Scenario: Corrupt or Unreadable Secret
    Given: I have a secret file that is corrupt or cannot be decrypted by my GPG key
    When: I expand that secret's section
    Then: The application does not crash
    And: The body of the expanded section displays a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Error: Could not load secret.")
    And: The console logs a detailed, technical error message for debugging

Scenario: Missing Configuration at Startup
    Given: My application configuration is missing a required value (e.g., recipient_email)
    When: I try to launch the application
    Then: The application panics and exits
    And: The panic message clearly explains which configuration key is missing and where to set it

Technical Notes:
1. User-facing errors should be simple and displayed directly in the UI.
2. Technical errors (including detailed error messages and potential stack traces) should be logged to the console using a standard logging library.
3. The README should be updated to explain how a user can enable detailed logging for bug reports.
