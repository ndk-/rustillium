As a user
I want to be able to search for a section by name
So that I can quickly find the section I'm looking for

Given: I have opened my application and it is displaying all sections as described in story1
When: I type a search term in the search box
Then: The application filters the sections and displays only the sections whose names contain the search term (case-insensitive)
