As a user
I want every change to my secrets to be automatically saved as a distinct version
So that I have a complete history of all modifications and can recover from accidental changes or deletions

Scenario #1: First-time use with existing secrets
    Given: I have an existing secrets directory from a previous version of the application
    When: I launch the application for the first time with the new history feature
    Then: The application automatically begins tracking changes to my secrets
    And: All of my current secrets are saved as the initial historical version

Scenario #2: Modifying a secret
    Given: My secrets are being tracked by the history feature
    When: I modify the contents of an existing secret and save it
    Then: The secret is updated as expected
    And: A new version is automatically and silently created in the history, preserving the state of my secret before the change

Scenario #3: Creating a new secret
    Given: My secrets are being tracked by the history feature
    When: I create and save a new secret
    Then: The new secret is created as expected
    And: The addition of this new secret is recorded as a new version in the history

Scenario #4: Renaming a secret
    Given: My secrets are being tracked by the history feature
    When: I rename an existing secret
    Then: The secret is renamed as expected
    And: The rename operation is recorded as a new version in the history

Scenario #5: Deleting a secret
    Given: My secrets are being tracked by the history feature
    When: I delete a secret
    Then: The secret is removed as expected
    And: The deletion of the secret is recorded as a new version in the history, making the action recoverable

Technical Notes:
1. This feature provides the backend for a robust history system. It does not include a user interface for browsing or reverting changes. Recovery of historical versions would be done manually for now, with the potential for a UI in a future story.
