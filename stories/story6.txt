As a user
I want to be able to configure my GPG recipient email address
So that the application knows which GPG key to use for encryption

Scenario #1:
  Given: I have set the RUSTILLIUM_RECIPIENT_EMAIL environment variable
  When: I open my application
  Then: The application uses the provided email address for encryption

Scenario #2:
  Given: I have a configuration file config.toml in directory $HOME/.config/rustillium with a recipient_email setting
  When: I open my application
  Then: The application uses the email address from the configuration file for encryption

Scenario #3:
  Given: I have both the configuration file from scenario #2 and the environment variable from scenario #1
  When: I open my application
  Then: The application uses the environment variable (precedence rule)
