As a user
I want to be able to view all my stored sections that contain username, password, and some extra fields
So that I can find which section I need to expand to see my credentials

Given: I have my credentials files (unencrypted for now)
When: I open my application
Then: I see all the sections (websites/apps) that has credentials stored in my files
